This will be the future home of the resources found in the Launch Pad of the group, which is currently private. We don't like the idea that the information we've gathered is available only to members of a particular group on a particular site. MyFitnessPal's forums aren't the most usable for banks of knowledge such as this, anyway.

# Contribution

Create or log in to your Github account and click "fork." Then, you can edit or add pages either within the Github interface, or on your own system by cloning the git repository. Create a Pull Request with a description of your changes for review. Accepted changes will be merged in. (This flow may change in the future, depending on how we ultimately structure this.)
